 *
 ****************  WARNING  ***********************
 *
 * This code has two major flaws:
 *
 * 1. Although nothing in the documentation says so,
 *    THIS ROUTINE COPIES ONLY TEXT FILES.  It uses
 *    'fgets' and 'fputs', which work only on "strings"
 *    (null-terminated sequences of characters).
 *    Since most binary files have many zero bytes,
 *    'fgets' will fill the buffer with characters
 *    (bytes), many of which are null, but 'fputs'
 *    will only write out the characters in the
 *    buffer up to the first null character; it
 *    does not output that null character or
 *    anything in the buffer after it. Typically,
 *    most of a binary file will NOT be copied.
 *    (To be fair to the original author, the purpose
 *    of this program was to illustrate command-line
 *    argument handling, not how to copy files, but
 *    a comment indicating that it works correctly
 *    only on text files would have been prudent.
 *
 * 2. This routine does no error checking. The 'fgets'
 *    function returns NULL in two cases: a) when an
 *    end-of-file occurs when no characters have been
 *    read and b) if an error occurs while reading.
 *    The return value of the 'fputs' function is not
 *    even checked -- it returns EOF on error.
 *
 * If you want a program that copies only text files,
 * this will work most of the time, but it is an
 * important principle that any system program --
 * and copying files is clearly a system task --
 * should check every function return value so it
 * can detect errors.

/*
 *  HOW NOT TO DO IT:
 *
    char buf[MAX];
    while( ( fgets( buf, MAX, source ) ) != NULL )
    {
        fputs( buf, dest );
    }
*/

/*
 *  HOW TO COPY TEXT FILES WITH ERROR-CHECKING:
 *
    char buf[MAX];
    while( ( fgets( buf, MAX, source ) ) != NULL )
    {
        if ( fputs( buf, dest ) == EOF )
	    fatalsys( "fputs" );
    }
    // Check if 'fgets' returned NULL due to an error.

/*
 *  HOW TO COPY TEXT OR BINARY FILES
 *
 *  'getc' and 'putc' are implemented in the Standard I/O Library
 *  in a way that makes them more efficient than they appear.
 *  Although it looks like we are reading and writing our way
 *  through the input and output files character-by character,
 *  they actually read from and write to buffers maintained by
 *  the 'stdio' library, and physical reads and writes are done
 *  in standard-sized chunks as the buffers are emptied or filled.
 *
 *  'getc' and 'putc' may be implemented as macros that are expanded
 *  inline, so they should not be called with arguments that may have
 *  side effects.
